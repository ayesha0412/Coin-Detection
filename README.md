# Coin-Detection
Implementation using MATLAB

Through preprocessing, region segmentation, and the extraction of size and colour features for classification, the MATLAB coin detection system makes use of image processing to identify coins. It uses COCO datasets for testing and training. An essential mathematical operation that helps identify coins and identify circular shapes is the Hough Transform. This system provides an effective and automated way to detect coins in a variety ofÂ applications.
